Vehicle break down. RE recognize power loss. All followers stop immediately

Leader and vehicles recognise problem in a vehicle and break the platoon. 
Vehicles, receiving a notice of failures from a vehicle, independently decide to switch to NOT control cruise. 
We want to verify that when the platoon breaks, vehicles do not follow each other and are NOT in cruise control.

The aim is to verify that vehicles stop before crashing. Probably we need to assume there is no communication delay.

The difference between #4 and #5 is that when the platoon breaks vehicles should switch to different control strategies.
